Generative audio visual android application.

The application is based around a Hadamard matrix feedback delay network. The spectral centroid is calculated and used to dampen delay line frequency. This leads to nonlinear dynamical behaviours in the application. This is carried out in the audio domain, patches in TwoCircles/res/raw/twocirclespd .

Audio is synthesised from four pulsar generators. Audio and visual parameters are modulated by parameters from the Hadamard delay lines.
